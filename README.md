# Letter-Analysis-Tool
It is a tool that allows  me to count the frequency of letters in text.

The goal is to be able to perform more complex analysis based on a simple sorting algorithm.
The initial letter frequency counter can be taken and modified to add additional functionalities.
  - This can be things like percentage of occurance of all letters in the text
  - Mean, median, and mode of the letters.
  - further developed to be able to analyze patterns in words, word frequency, and word occurance heat maps.
  - Additional functionality can be added with mocrocontrollers, live data feeds, and real world applications.

This is my first serious project, and I will be using it to help learn programming, and scientific analysis.
